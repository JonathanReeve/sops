Third party that witnesses an online interaction

## What do we make of people that do not see interaction but later hear of the deletion of the content (often with no clear explanation as to why the social media platform deleted it--and even if they hear the reason it is usually filtered through what the person whose post was blocked wants to make public)
 - there is no means by which any member of a social media platform can know that something she scrolled by (a day, a week, or even longer ago) has now been removed and deemed inappropriate for the platform. However this individual's conception of the norms is shaped by what she sees online which is assumed to be permissible by the social media site's guidelines (it is already online so it is/was permitted to be online)


# Social-psychology of bullying/harassment and bystanders
 - an individual is much more likely to engage in bullying/hateful behavior if they are in an environemtn that they perceive to tolerate or even reward such behavior. 
   - One way of interpreting this fact's influence on social media guidelines is to say that we ought to rapidly remove abusive content so that cyberbystanders do not see the abusive content and come to view the norms on this platform as ones that condone suhc content. 
    - Another conclusion one can draw from this is that it is important to not amplify abusive content in a way that would give cyberbystanders the impression that the social media platform is overrun with harmful content (unless it is of course). This point is addressed by Lori Tharps in the article ['Reprint reportingâ€™ and race](archives.cjr.org/minority_reports/reprint_reporting_and_race.php). 


# What attention is paid to cyberbystanders by current social media policy? 

For the most part the protocol is to delete the post with little explantion even to those who are involved in the posting and reporting

On some social media sites you are prompted by a message warning that this content (usually a comment or a tweet) has been marked as offensive/harmful 
Examples of this include twitter

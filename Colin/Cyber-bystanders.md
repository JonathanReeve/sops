## What is a cyberbystander

Third party that witnesses an online interaction. Most users of social media sites have witnessed some form of hamful online behavior as a cyberbystander. In these situations it is more common for people to do nothing, and second most common for them to intervene in defense of the person being targetted. There are also instances where cyberbystanders pile on harfmul speech.

## Social-psychology of bullying/harassment and bystanders

Studies have found that individuals are much more likely to engage in bullying/hateful behavior if they are in an environment that they perceive to tolerate or even reward such behavior. This highlights the importance of removing harmful content from social media sites before it is widely viewed by other users. This is because the amount of harmful content cyberbystanders see influences their understanding of acceptable norms on the platform.

    - Another conclusion one can draw from this is that it is important to not amplify abusive content in a way that would give cyberbystanders the impression that the social media platform is overrun with harmful content (unless it is of course). This point is addressed by Lori Tharps in the article ['Reprint reportingâ€™ and race](archives.cjr.org/minority_reports/reprint_reporting_and_race.php).

### passive and non-present bystanders  
What do we make of people that do not see interaction but later hear of the deletion of the content (often with no clear explanation as to why the social media platform deleted it--and even if they hear the reason it is usually filtered through what the person whose post was blocked wants to make public)
 - there is no means by which any member of a social media platform can know that something she scrolled by (a day, a week, or even longer ago) has now been removed and deemed inappropriate for the platform. However this individual's conception of the norms is shaped by what she sees online which is assumed to be permissible by the social media site's guidelines (it is already online so it is/was permitted to be online)





## What attention is paid to cyberbystanders by current social media policy? 

For the most part the protocol is to delete the post with little explantion even to those who are involved in the posting and reporting

On some social media sites you are prompted by a message warning that this content (usually a comment or a tweet) has been marked as offensive/harmful 
Examples of this include twitter

 ### Restorative Justice
 
 - define--metion that it is used in schools
 
 - the importance of community building
   - community building is a central pillar to making restorative justice work. THe fact that the entire community (not just those involved in confrontational behavior) will be involved in mediating and restoring situations means that there needs to be a certain level of comfort with conveining in restorative circles. FOr this reason schools employing restorative justice will have daily or weekly meetings/circles/discussions with students and faculty in order to foster comfort and standards for when there needs to be a restorative session
   - restorative sessions allow for those who are affected by a harfmul interaction (beyond just the prepetrator and target) to discuss what was wrong with the behavior and gain a more thorough understanding of how this event should impact their understanding of acceptable norms and behaviors.

A useful method of typologizing harmful speech online is by distinguishing between the types of exchanges (vectors). (This is basedon the models put forward in  Counterspeech on Twitter: A Field Study)
 
 -One-to-one: one person deploying counterspeech against one person’s hate speech
 
 -One-to-many: one person deploying counterspeech against many people’s hate speech
 
 -Many-to-one: many people deploying counterspeech against one person’s hate speech
 
 -Many-to-many: many people deploying counterspeech against many people’s hate speech

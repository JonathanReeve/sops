# The Problems

## Abusive Language: Statistics and Taxonomies (Colin and Jonathan) 

### Taxonomies

 - Hate speech
 - Bullying
 - Harassment and stalking
 - Dangerous speech
 - Abuse of journalists
   - "Gamergate"
 - Related language patterns that, while not strictly abusive language, could be useful to its detection
   - Misinformation (e.g. Russian fake news)
   - Deceptive opinion spam (e.g. fake Amazon product reviews) 

#### Alternative Taxonomies (Colin)


### Statistics 

 - General stats related to abusive langauge
 - Cyberbulling stats
 - Hate speech stats

# Existing Approaches

## Organizations 

### Advocacy Groups (Colin and Jonathan)

 - [Women's Media Center Speech Project](http://wmcspeechproject.com/)
 - Working to Halt Online Abuse
 - No Hate Speech Movement
 - Etc...

#### Legal Aid
#### Education

### Initiatives by Social Media Platforms

 - Official policies of Facebook, Twitter
 - Twitter's "progress on addressing online abuse"
 - Implementations of Perspective API on Facebook, Reddit
 - New social media outlets (Mastodon) created with these problems in mind
 - Moderation, flagging

### Organizations and Projects Employing Machine Learning 

 - Jigsaw (Google)
   - Perspective API
 - Wikimedia Foundation WikiDeTox project
 - Brief survey of US patents for detection of "offensiveness"
 
### Databases and Datasets

 - Trolldor: "the global blacklist of twitter trolls"
 - Hatebase
 - Gamergate tweets
 - Public training data from Kaggle contest and other similar projects

## Computational Detection of Abusive Language, Behaviors, or People (Jonathan)

### General Classification Studies

 - Tokenization and pre-processing
 - Features used
 - Classifiers used
 - Meta-classification


### Detection of Quality, Formality

 - Formality scores
 - Grammatical quality
 
### Detection and Analysis of Swearing

 - Disambiguation of friendly and abusive swearing

### Sentiment Analysis

### Metadata Analysis

 - Detection of bots, trolls
 - Social network theory
 - Trust propogation

### Related Fields

 - Detection of deceptive opinion spam 
 - Detection of misinformation

## And the Law (Colin)

## Counterspeech (Colin)

 - Kevin Munger article

### Types

A useful method of typologizing harmful speech online is by distinguishing between the types of exchanges (vectors). (This is basedon the models put forward in Counterspeech on Twitter: A Field Study)
 
 - One-to-one: one person deploying counterspeech against one person’s hate speech
 - One-to-many: one person deploying counterspeech against many people’s hate speech
 - Many-to-one: many people deploying counterspeech against one person’s hate speech
 - Many-to-many: many people deploying counterspeech against many people’s hate speech
 
# Future Directions

## Potential Applications of Related Fields (Jonathan)

### Psycholinguistics

 - Linguistic properties of emotional speech
 - "Language of psychopathy"

### Fusions of Existing Approaches 

 - Formality detection and social network theory
 - Quality ranking

## Automated Counterspeech
